# WP Auto Update Pages WordPress Plugin

WP Auto Replace Pages Allows users to completely rebuild any existing page on their site in advance and schedule the
content replacement date.

**NOTE:** 
This plugin completely replaces a given pages content on the pre-set date. It does not affect the slug so any previously shared links should continue to work as expected.
Use with caution.

To install:

* Clone this repo
* Upload WP Auto Update Pages to your WordPress Plugins directory via FTP or zip it and use the WordPress plugin
  installer to upload it.
* Activate the plugin

To get started:

* Go to WP Auto Replace Pages->Add New.
* Under Advance Publish select a date to replace your existing content
* Select a page to be updated
* Add your new content in the editor as usual
* Publish as usual (will not be publicly viewable)
