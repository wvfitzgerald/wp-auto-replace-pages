# WP Auto Replace Pages WordPress Plugin

WP Auto Replace Pages Allows users to completely rebuild any existing page on their site in advance and schedule the
content replacement date.

**NOTE:** 

This plugin completely replaces a given pages content on the pre-set date. It does not affect the slug so any previously shared links should continue to work as expected.
Use with caution.

  installer to upload it.

* Go to WP Auto Replace Pages->Add New.
